Purpose of the Project The primary purpose of this project is to create a functional and user-friendly calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project allows you to apply your knowledge of front-end technologies to build an interactive application while reinforcing problem-solving skills and logical thinking.

Features of My Calculator Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functionality. User-Friendly Interface: Buttons are clearly labeled and well-placed for intuitive usage. Error Handling: The calculator gracefully handles invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero or malformed expressions). Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices of varying screen sizes.

Creating a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your CodSoft task project is an excellent way to demonstrate your web development skills. A calculator is a practical and functional application that showcases your understanding of user interface (UI) design, interactivity, and JavaScript logic. Below is a detailed explanation of your project.
